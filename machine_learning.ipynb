It has been adapted from Brainhack Global MTL 2019 traintrack tutorial (https://github.com/BrainhackMTL/global2019-traintrack/blob/master/machine_learning.ipynb) by Désirée Lussier which was modified from the MAIN 2019 training given by Alexadre Hutton (https://github.com/main-training/main-training-nilearn-ml/blob/master/01_intro_ml.ipynb; https://github.com/main-training/main-training-nilearn-ml/blob/master/01_intro_ml_slides.odp) and sklearn tutorial (http://scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html).\n",
